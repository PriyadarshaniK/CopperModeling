Regression and Classification models used to predict Selling Price and Status of Industrial Copper 

The copper industry deals with less complex data related to sales and pricing.
    However, this data may suffer from issues such as skewness and noisy data, which can affect the accuracy of manual predictions.
    Dealing with these challenges manually can be time-consuming and may not result in optimal pricing decisions.
    A machine learning regression model can address these issues by utilizing advanced techniques such as data normalization, feature scaling, and outlier detection, and leveraging algorithms that are robust to skewed and noisy data.
    Another area where the copper industry faces challenges is in capturing the leads.
    A lead classification model is a system for evaluating and classifying leads based on how likely they are to become a customer.
    This project hence aims to create a regression model to predict Selling Price given all other relevant parameters and also use a classification model to predict Status of the lead whether Won or Lost.
